# Atlus Navigator

## A TypeScript-Powered Discord bot for discovering enemy weaknesses in Atlus Games

Atlus Navigator is designed to help players quickly identify the weaknesses of enemies in popular Atlus RPGs, including Persona 3 Reload (and Episode Aigis), Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5 Royal, and Metaphor: ReFantazio. Instead of searching through multiple tabs or wikis to find enemy weaknesses, simply tell the bot the game and enemy you're facing, and it will provide a detailed weakness chart. Plan your strategy in advance or uncover unexpected vulnerabilities mid-battle, all without leaving Discord!

## How to run this project for your own uses (or to potentially help me 👀)

### Prerequisites
* Install Node v20
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
* Get a **Discord bot token** through the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)

### Build Guide
1. Clone the project repository. 
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add an environment variable representing the Discord bot token value (ex. `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = XXX`).
4. If you want to change the default database credentials, modify the values in `x-db-env` within `docker-compose.yml`. These credentials will be used by the Postgres container when it starts.
5. Run `docker compose build`.
