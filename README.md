# Atlus Navigator

## A TypeScript-Powered Discord bot for discovering enemy & persona weaknesses in Atlus Games

Atlus Navigator is designed to help players quickly identify the weaknesses of enemies in popular Atlus RPGs, including Persona 3 Reload (and Episode Aigis), Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5 Royal, and Metaphor: ReFantazio. Instead of searching through multiple tabs or wikis to find enemy weaknesses, simply tell the bot the game and enemy you're facing, and it will provide a detailed weakness chart. Plan your strategy in advance or uncover unexpected vulnerabilities mid-battle, all without leaving Discord!

## How to run this project for your own uses (or to potentially help me üëÄ)

### Prerequisites

### Build Guide
1. Clone the project repository. 
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add an environment variable representing the Discord bot token value (ex. `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = XXX`).
